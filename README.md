# SimpleBot
Used Python with it's Twitter libraries to make a bot that favorites tweets with key words or hashtags.

I miss out on a lot of news and updates on my favorite sports teams, video games / developers, and liked youtubers, celebrities, and so on. I can spend a while scrolling through countless tweets looking at everything, but there's often a lot of ads or tweets that I find pointless. Sometime I want a concentrated amount of tweets focused on a subject. That is what this bot will do. So that when I get back to my phone I can just go to my liked tweets and see what I want to. I used the tweepy library available for Python.

Depending on events going on, I wanted to make it easier to update keywords rather than hardcoding terms into variables. So I made a GUI where I can specify what i want to see and how much using Tkinter.
